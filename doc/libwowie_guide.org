* Libwowie : 'Cause f*ck it, You need a lib with this stuff anyways.
  Sheer laziness is what inspired this. Aren't you tired of having to implement a bunch
  of stuff you could just have at your fingertips with a single #include?

* What's in there?
  - Data structures
    - Linked Lists
    - Stacks
    - Linked-List powered Stacks (lstacks)
    - B-Trees
    - Binary Heaps
    - Hashmaps (crc32)
  - Singleton buffers
  - Memory manipulation
  - String manipulation
  - A generic error interface
  - Search functions
  - <stdint.h> Type conversions
  - Linear algebra library (BSVL)

  Most of these have accompanying test suites.

* What's being worked on?
   see [module_name]/todo.org

* How to extend this lib
** Code your own stuff - HMU on bluesky if you think it's worth telling me about 🤓
  1. Implement your extension & its Makefile
     ! Note: I will not accept any PRs without tests !
  2. Implement it's error() stuff.
  3. Add it to the master Makefile.
  4. Recompile
