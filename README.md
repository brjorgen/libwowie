# Libwowie : 'Cause f\*ck it, You need a lib with this stuff anyways.

Sheer laziness is what inspired this. Aren't you tired of having to implement a bunch
of stuff you could just have at your fingertips with a single #include?

# What's in there?

-   Data structures
    -   Linked Lists
    -   Stacks
    -   Linked-List powered Stacks (lstacks)
    -   B-Trees
    -   Binary Heaps
    -   Hashmaps (crc32)
-   Singleton buffers
-   Memory manipulation
-   String manipulation
-   A generic error interface
-   Search functions
-   <stdint.h> Type conversions
-   Linear algebra library (BSVL)

Most of these have accompanying test suites.

## Code your own stuff - HMU on twitter if you think it's worth telling me about ðŸ¤“

1.  Implement your extension & its Makefile (ideally with a rule for building a test binary).
2.  Implement it's error() stuff.
3.  Add it to the master Makefile.
4.  Recompile.
